**Industry/Market:** Supply Chain Technology / Industrial SaaS

**Business Type:** ☑ B2B SaaS

## Problem and Opportunity

### Target Customer
**Primary Customer Segment:** Mid-market manufacturing companies ($50M-$500M annual revenue) with complex supply chains involving 20+ suppliers and multiple distribution channels.

**Customer Size/Demographics:**
